Superdog


Based on College Gameday weekly SuperDog picks.
Multiple players can play. Each player chooses a "superdog", akin to an underdog, to beat the spread on a given weekend of college football games.
Players accumulate points each week and compete against each other throughout the season.
Outright wins give more points.

Ideally I'd like this game to keep track of the user's picks and accumulate scores automatically based on an available API somewhere of real-time games.

I do not claim to own or have come up with this idea.
